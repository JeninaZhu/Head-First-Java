//伪码
//声明变量
DELCARE and instantiate(实例化) the GameHelper instance variable(实例变量).
DELCARE and instantiate the ArratList to hold the list of DotComs(initially three) Call it dotComsList.
DELCARE an int variable to hold the number of user guesses (so that we can give the user a score at the end of the game).
        Name it numOfGuesses and set it to 0
//声明方法
DELCARE a setUpGame() method to create and initialize the DotCom objects with names and locations.
        Display brief instructions to the user.
DELCARE a startPlaying() method that asks the player for guesses and calls the checkUserGuess() method until all the 
        DotCom objects are removed from play.
DELCARE a checkUserGuess() method that loops through all remaining DotCom objects and calls each DotCom object's checkYourself() method.
DELCARE a finishGame() method that prints a message about the user's performance,based on how many guesses it took to sink
        all of the DotCom objects.
//实现方法
MOTHOD:void setUpGame()
  //make three DotCom objects and name them
  CREATE three DotCom objects.
  SET a name for each DotCom.
  ADD the DotComs to the dotComsList(the ArrayList).
  REPEAT with each of the DotCom objects in the dotComsList array.
    CALL the placeDotCom() method on the helper object,to get a randomly-selected location for 
         this DotCom(three cells,vertically or horizongtally aligned,on a 7x7 grid).
    SET the location for each DotCom based on the result of the placeDotCom() call.
  END REPEAT
END METHOD

MOTHOD:void startPlaying()
  REPEAT while any DotComs exist
      GET user input by calling the helper getUserInput() method
      EVALUATE the user's guess by checkUserGuess() method
  END REPEAT
END METHOD

MOTHOD:void checkUserGuess(String userGuess)
  //find out if there's a hit (and kill) on any DotCom
  INCREMENT the number of user guesses in the numOfGuesses variable
  SET the local result variable(a String) to "miss",assuming that the user's guess will be a miss.
  REPEAT with each of the DotObjects in the dotComsList array
    EVALUATE the user's guess by calling the DotCom object's checkYourself() method
    SET the result variable to "hit" or "kill" if appropriate
    IF the result is "kill",REMOVE the DotCom from the dotComsList
  END REPEAT
  DISPLAY the result value to the user
END METHOD

MOTHOD:void finishGame()
   DISPLAY a generic "ganme over" message,then:
      IF number of user guesses is small,
        DISPLAY a congratulations message
      ELSE
        DISPLAY an insulting one
END METHOD
